			  <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Lionel Messi's life:</h3>
			  <ul>
				<li><strong>1987</strong> - Born in  Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>2003–2005: Rise to the first team</strong> - During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with 
				  Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a 
				  single campaign.[31] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season 
				  competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being 
				  promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player</strong> - On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi 
				  signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years 
				  less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million.[41] His breakthrough 
				  came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition.
				   A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, 
				   receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[48] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but 
				   Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>2008–09: First treble</strong> - FAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an
			      overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was 
				  given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8 million, 
				  becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his 
				  frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. 
				  To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him 
				  a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a 
				  result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full 
				  potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted 
				  runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>2009–10: First Ballon d'Or</strong> - His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year. After victories in the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.[94] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>2010–2011: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League</strong> - TMessi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat.[103] Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[104] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[105][106] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[75][107] Under the award's old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>2012: A record-breaking year</strong> - As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, 
				  the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. 
				  On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, 
				  he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, 
				  an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the 
				  +joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José 
				  Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer 
				  in four campaigns. Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César 
				  Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>2005–2006: Senior and World Cup debuts</strong> - In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision. Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[386] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his "re-debut" ahead of the match. Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as "a jewel". He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.
				</li>
				
				<li>
				  <strong>2014–15: Second treble</strong> - Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year. A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra. A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals. Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.

				  <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
				  supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
				  we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
				  are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
				  plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
				  people were selecting the best breeds."
				</li>
				<li><strong>2021–2022: Copa América and World Cup triumphs</strong> - On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick 
					in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's 
					opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil. On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled 
					Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the 
					tournament.[499] A week later, he broke the record when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final 
					group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two. On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored 
					from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition. On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the 
					semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the 
					tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament 
					from five years earlier; he later scored his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to 
					his fifth international final. On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts and defending champions Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi 
					his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall. 
					Messi was directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of 
					the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's 
					Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.<br>
					On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as 
					South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.  In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, 
					at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy 
					for Argentina at the senior level.  Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over 
					Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men's top scorers.<br>
					<strong>Messi at the 2022 FIFA World Cup</strong> At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's 
					opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which
					Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández's goal.[511] In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored 
					the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance, and became the most-capped male South 
					American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing 
					and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records. In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted 
					Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time.
					Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty. In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a 
					record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with 
					a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win;[516] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi
					 overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all-time top-scorer at the World Cup. Argentina advanced to the final against France, with
					  Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.</p>
					<br>In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored 
					Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score 
					a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition. After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, 
					who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. 
					Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually 
					winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy. Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player 
					to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé.[521] With his appearance and two 
					goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal
					 contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists). The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage 
					 heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé. Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying 
					 "I want to continue playing as a champion".
